## Why i'm starting new habits?

So, for some time now I've been feeling like I haven't been very productive. 
For some context, currently I'm enrolling six different classes at college, each of them occupying 4 hours a week, plus the time needed to study and deliver projects and stuff, alongside that I'm part of an extracurricular activity, also at college, in which we are developing a mobile app, so basically I have to take part in the development of this app and participate in daily meetings and I also have a full time job as a software enginner, it's very flexible and I don't have to acctually work 8 hours a day, I only have to finish my proposed assignments and be present in meetings, and for last I've been trying to exercise more, so I try to have some time to boulder and exercise a little.

I have a lot of stuff to do and haven't been organizing my time to do all of this properly. This has been resulting in a failing feeling, I haven't been feeling like anything I was doing was being well done.

Long story short, I've decided to start using a calendar to manage my time and to decide what are my objective for now.

## Objectives

So first thing I've done was to list what are my priorities and objectives for now. And They are:

 - Be more dedicated at work 
 - Be more focused on college related activities
 - Exercise more

It looks like I'm saying that I need to keep doing what I have already been doing. But I feel like it's more of a chance of approach rater than a change of activities.

## What I will try to do 

### Be more dedicated at work 

To be more dedicated at work I've decided to reserve at least 20 hours a week In which I need to be focused on work. 
What I mean by that is that I'll stop sharing the same time for taking classes and working and will try to be away from my phone in that time, so that I can have more focus. Since it's my first priority and it is a full time job, if needed other times will be allocated to it.

### Be more focused on college related activities 

Well, to be more focused on classes and other college related activities I will be reserving class hour to be acctualy paying attention to classes. If classes end early or are cancelled for that day I will be using that time to do other college related stuff, so it basically has a priority list:

 - Taking class
 - Working on assignments for that class
 - Working on assignments for other classes
 - Study for classes that I feel like I need to

### Exercise more

So as I said before I really enjoy bouldering, but I also feel like I need to work on my strength more, so I've decided to boulder 3 times a week, from those 3 days, one will be focused on movementation, one in volume and the last one on free climbing. 
Aside from bouldering I wll be trying a body weight routine I've found here [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) twice a week. From the other 2 missing days, one will be used only for resting and the other one will be used for a stretching routine.

Each day will have about an hour of dedication for fitness.

## Tech used

So I'm trying not to use many apps for this, since I don't have the habit for doing all these things properly yet, but the ones I'm using are:

 - Google calendar, to manage my time and notify me when I should be doing something 
 - Notion, to arrenge my fitness routine
