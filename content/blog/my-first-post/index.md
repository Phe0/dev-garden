## Presentation

Hello!

My name is Pedro Henrique Féo, I'm currently a college student studying Software Engineering at University of Brasília in Brazil. I'm Also a full time software engineer at [Probono Digital](https://probonodigital.com), a legaltech startup focused on bringing the best experience to people enrolled in legal processes.

Some of my hobbies consist of drawing, boldering and spending time with friends (remotelly nowadays =( ).

## Objectives

I'm writing this blog as an opportunity to think a little deeper on the things that I learn in a daily basis. And better store it, making it easy for me and others to find it.
